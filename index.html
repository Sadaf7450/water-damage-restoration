    <h2>Understanding Water Damage</h2>
    <p>Water damage comes in various forms, each requiring a different approach for restoration. There are three main types of water damage:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Clean Water:</strong> This type of damage is caused by water from clean sources such as broken pipes, overflowing sinks, or rainwater. It poses no immediate health risks.</li>
        <li><strong>Grey Water:</strong> This is slightly contaminated water from appliances like washing machines, dishwashers, or toilets (without solid waste). It can cause illness if ingested.</li>
        <li><strong>Black Water:</strong> This highly contaminated water contains harmful bacteria and pathogens. It originates from sewage backups, flooding from rivers, or seawater. Black water poses significant health risks and requires immediate professional intervention.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Common causes of water damage include flooding, burst pipes, roof leaks, and malfunctioning appliances. If left untreated, water damage can lead to severe problems such as mold growth, weakened structural integrity, and damage to personal belongings.</p>

    <h2>The Water Damage Restoration Process</h2>
    <p>Restoring a property after water damage involves several critical steps to ensure thorough cleanup and repair. Here is an overview of the process:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Initial Assessment and Inspection:</strong> Professionals inspect the affected areas to determine the extent of the damage and the type of water involved. This assessment helps in developing a detailed restoration plan.</li>
        <li><strong>Water Extraction and Removal:</strong> The next step is to remove any standing water using pumps and vacuums. Quick removal is crucial to prevent further damage and mold growth.</li>

        <li><strong>Cleaning and Sanitizing:</strong> All affected items and surfaces are cleaned and sanitized to remove bacteria, mold, and other contaminants. Specialized cleaning agents and techniques are used to ensure thorough disinfection.</li>
        <li><strong>Restoration and Repairs:</strong> The final step involves repairing and restoring damaged structures and materials. This can range from minor repairs like replacing drywall to major reconstruction projects.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Benefits of Professional Water Damage Restoration</h2>
    <p>Hiring professional water damage restoration services offers several advantages:</p>
    <ul>
